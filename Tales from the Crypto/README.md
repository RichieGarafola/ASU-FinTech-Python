## Instructions

### 1 - Sentiment Analysis

Use the [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum and create a DataFrame of sentiment scores for each coin.

Use descriptive statistics to answer the following questions:

> Which coin had the highest mean positive score?
>
> Which coin had the highest negative score?
>
> Which coin had the highest positive score?



### 2 - Natural Language Processing

In this section, you will use NLTK and Python to tokenize text, find n-gram counts, and create word clouds for both coins. 

#### Tokenize

Be sure to:

1. Lowercase each word.
2. Remove punctuation.
3. Remove stop words.

#### N-grams

Next, look at the ngrams and word frequency for each coin.

1. Use NLTK to produce the ngrams for N = 2.
2. List the top 10 words for each coin.

#### Word Clouds

Finally, generate word clouds for each coin to summarize the news for each coin.
