# <h3 align = "center">*Overview and Origin*</h3>
---
 
    
> Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb founded Ripple, a payment processing and remittance company, in 2012. Ripple uses an asset exchange and remittance system similar to the bank's SWIFT system for international money transfers. Using an open source decentralized peer-to-peer platform, Ripple allows for seamless money transfers in any currency, whether it's fiat money in the form of dollars, pounds, yen or euros or cryptocurrency in the form of Litecoin, Bitcoin or Ethereum. With major financial institutions and banks among its customers, Ripple is a global payment network. XRP is used in its products to facilitate quick conversion between different currencies.
    
> Ripple is a privately funded company, which has closed five rounds of funding, including two rounds of angel funding, one round of seed funding, one round of Series A funding, one round of Series B funding, and one round of Series C funding. The primary source of funding Ripple has been sales of the XRP cryptocurrency. Between Q4 2016 and Q2 2020, it sold $1,254.54 million in XRP on cryptocurrency exchanges, to a mix of institutional investors and retail investors. The company's mission is to provide an efficient and direct money transfer system that is cheaper, safer, more transparent and can settle in real time rather than the traditional financial institution money transfer systems. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies aim to revolutionize the way cross-border transactions take place, bridging fiat and digital currencies.



### <h3 align = "center">*Major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years*</h3>
---    
*Ripple is amongst the leading innovators in the Blockchain / Computer Technology domain of the financial industry.*   

    
    
- **Eco-friendly Blockchain** - The issue of continuous carbon emissions is one of the pitfalls of blockchain technology. Several new and innovative approaches are emerging as solutions to this problem, such as carbon offsetting. Carbon offset generally refers to the increase in carbon storage used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or offset emissions generated elsewhere.
    
- **Central Banks Digital Currencies** - As national currencies develop, they target digital currencies that can work alongside traditional currencies. This could enable users to complete financial transactions and manage the custody of their assets on the blockchain. Users do not need to rely on third-party providers, and central banks could also manage control over the circulating supply as well.
    
- **Manufacturing and Tracking Vaccines with Blockchain** - Vaccine shipments could be tracked and verified through blockchain and the distribution of vaccines could be traced to ensure that vaccine shipments arrive at their intended locations. This could strengthen the verification of vaccine integrity at different points in the supply chain. Blockchain technology, for example, can aid with the consistent storage of vaccination batches at the proper temperature.
    
- **Tokenization, Non-fungible tokens or NFTs** - NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of real-world items like art, video clips, music, and more. The potential of NFTs, exceeds far beyond their initial use cases however.
    
- **The Rise of the Metaverse** - A metaverse is essentially a shared virtual world that provides users with immersive experiences. Participants can interact with the metaverse by constructing digital avatars that interact with others. In-world events, items, and landscapes might all be created using these avatars.
    
- **Transformation in financial service** - It is possible through distributed ledger technology to reduce fees and provide real-time payments between financial institutions. Utilizing decentralized ledgers for payments could help to re-imagine global trade finance by driving efficiencies, lowering costs and opening up new revenue opportunities.

- **Scalability** - Ripple will grow higher in the future. Generally, has no connection with the external market shocks and price volatilities. What makes Ripple an exception from other cryptocurrencies is, it has a huge market cap, and it utilizes consensus ledgers when it comes to transactions. 
    
- **Public Relations** - Raise brand awareness by building its culture and image in the eyes of the general public as well as commercial enthusiasts.
    
- **Low Fees** -  Ripple has a speedy transaction time and comparably low transaction fees.  
    
    
    
### <h3 align = "center">*Core metrics this domain uses to measure success*</h3>   
---
    
- **Active Nodes (Active Addresses)** - This is calculated by compiling and recording how many unique nodes are active during a predetermined time frame, such as per day, per week, or per month. The greater the number of unauthorized blockchains, the more nodes are using and trusting the blockchain. The value of the active node is usually available on all participating nodes.

- **Blocks Per Hour, Blocks Per Day** - Measure the speed at which records are submitted and stored on the blockchain network and how fast the network can carry out its consensus algorithm. The capacity of the block is fixed, so the amount of blocks processed can be calculated accordingly. Each block created has a time stamp. Timestamps allow the blockchain system to measure the number of blocks created and added during a particular time period such as per hour or per day. These measurements are useful for assessing the performance and scalability of blockchain systems.

- **Transactions Per Second** - Measures the amount of records sent and stored or transactional records per second. It is used to evaluate the throughput of the blockchain network  and  its scalability requirements. The amount of records sent to the network and the amount of records stored in the ledger are usually measured separately.

- **Transaction Latency** - Measures the time between a transaction being sent to the network and the time the transaction is written (or rejected) to the ledger. This metric is measured by checking the transaction's timestamp and comparing the time the transaction was sent with the time it was validated and saved. This metric also provides insight into the speed at which consensus algorithms run.

- **Transaction Throughput** - This metric is used to measure the time it takes for a valid record to be added to the block. The total number of committed and validated records is divided by the total  time (in seconds) it takes to commit (validate and save) those records. Invalid records are not committed, so invalid  or transaction records are deducted from the total.

- **Full Node/Partial Node Ratio** - Measures the number of active full and partial nodes in the blockchain network and returns a value that represents the ratio of full and partial nodes. This measurement is important because full copies of the distributed ledgers historical data can be lost if there are no active full nodes in the blockchain network. Maintaining sufficient redundant copies of the distributed ledger is very important, so this measurement is closely tracked.

    
*Ripple settlement speed is exponentially faster than competitors. Ripple settles in approximately 4 seconds while ETH is 4+ minutes and bitcoin is 1+ hours. Traditional Systems settle between 3-5 days.*

    
    
    
    
    
    
### <h3 align = "center">*Performance relative to competitors*</h3>   
---
    
Blockchain solutions are in demand by banks, financial institutions, government agencies and corporations alike because they facilitate near-instant transaction processing on a decentralized ledger that is accessible via the Internet and mobile based software. This is what Ripple provides, and it has the capability to transform cross-border transactions into an instant communication system, where moving from one currency to another takes only a few seconds rather than days! By participating in Ripple, banks, payment providers, exchanges and businesses will be able to accommodate many commercial use cases. Some commercial use cases include: eInvoicing, International Supply Chain Payment, Global Currency Account, Real Time Cash Pooling,  International Invoice Payment, Real Time Wire Transfer and International  P2P Payment.
    
    
### <h3 align = "center">*My 2-cents*</h3>   
---
    
It would be extremely beneficial and incentivize investors to become long term holders if decentralized finance (DeFi) was incorporated into Ripples business model as crypto staking and investment services are appealing to the masses. Gives users more control over their money through personal wallets and trading services that cater to individuals.
    
Since all the XRP coins are pre-mined and already in circulation, a limited supply could push up demand in the future, leading to big price increases and bigger profits for early investors. Staking is a way of supporting the blockchain of a cryptocurrency you're invested in. Cryptocurrencies rely on holders staking to verify transactions and keep everything running smoothly. It's an easy way to earn interest on your holdings while helping to maintain the security and efficiency of the over all blockchain.
