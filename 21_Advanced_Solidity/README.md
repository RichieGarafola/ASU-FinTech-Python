# Unit 21: Martian Token Crowdsale

![alt=""](Images/application-image.png)

## Background

After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected you to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose you to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. You decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. You’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

## Instructions

The steps for this assignment are divided into the following subsections:

1. Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

2. Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

3. Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

4. Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain

5. Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

    > **Note:** You can choose whether to complete the optional section. It’s designed to further your professional growth and development but won’t be graded as part of this assignment. If you choose to complete this section, you’ll use OpenZeppelin to extend the functionality of your crowdsale contract by adding time restrictions, refund capabilities, and a cap for the number of tokens that can be created. If you have any questions about how to complete the optional section, please reach out to your instructional team.

Note that the provided starter files for this homework assignment contain a `pragma` statement for Solidity version 0.5.0. You’ll use the starter files to complete the steps in the subsections.

In the subsections, you’ll create a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. This token will be minted by using a `Crowdsale` contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that you create will manage the entire crowdsale process. This process will allow users to send ether to the contract and receive KaseiCoin tokens, or **KAI**, in return. Your contract will automatically mint the tokens and distribute them to a buyer in one transaction.

Note that you’ll record a short video or animated GIF or take several screenshots that show the deployed contract in action.

In the `README.md` file of your GitHub repository for this homework assignment, you’ll create a section named Evaluation Evidence. In this section, you’ll share screenshots of your work from each subsection of the assignment.

### Step 1: Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract

In this subsection, you’ll create a smart contract that defines KaseiCoin as an ERC-20 token. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Import the provided `KaseiCoin.sol` starter file into the Remix IDE.

2. Import the following contracts from the OpenZeppelin library:

    * `ERC20`

    * `ERC20Detailed`

    * `ERC20Mintable`

3. Define a contract for the KaseiCoin token, and name it `KaseiCoin`. Have the contract inherit the three contracts that you just imported from OpenZeppelin.

4. Inside your `KaseiCoin` contract, add a constructor with the following parameters: `name`, `symbol`, and `initial_supply`.

5. As part of your constructor definition, add a call to the constructor of the `ERC20Detailed` contract, passing the parameters `name`, `symbol`, and `18`. (Recall that 18 is the value for the `decimals` parameter.)

6. Compile the contract by using compiler version 0.5.0.

7. Check for any errors, and debug them as needed.

8. Take a screenshot of the successful compilation of the contract, and add it to the Evaluation Evidence section of the `README.md` file for your GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract

In this subsection, you’ll define the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Import the provided `KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol` starter code into the Remix IDE.

2. Have this contract inherit the following OpenZeppelin contracts:

    * `Crowdsale`

    * `MintedCrowdsale`

3. In the `KaisenCoinCrowdsale` constructor, provide parameters for all the features of your crowdsale, such as `rate`, `wallet` (where to deposit the funds that the token raises), and `token`. Configure these parameters as you want for your KaseiCoin token.

4. Compile the contract by using compiler version 0.5.0.

5. Check for any errors, and debug them as needed.

6. Take a screenshot of the successful compilation of the contract, and add it to the Evaluation Evidence section of the `README.md` file for your GitHub repository.

### Step 3: Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract

In this subsection, you’ll create the KaseiCoin deployer contract. Start by uncommenting the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract in the provided `KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol` starter code.

Next, in the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract, you’ll add variables to store the addresses of the `KaseiCoin` and `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contracts, which this contract will deploy. Finally, you’ll complete the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract. To do so, complete the following steps:

1. Create an `address public` variable named `kasei_token_address`, which will store the `KaseiCoin` address once that contract has been deployed.

2. Create an `address public` variable named `kasei_crowdsale_address`, which will store the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` address once that contract has been deployed.

3. Add the following parameters to the constructor for the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract: `name`, `symbol`, and `wallet`.

4. Inside of the constructor body (that is, between the braces), complete the following steps:

    * Create a new instance of the `KaseiCoinToken` contract.

    * Assign the address of the KaseiCoin token contract to the `kasei_token_address` variable. (This will allow you to easily fetch the token's address later.)

    * Create a new instance of the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract by using the following parameters:

      * The `rate` parameter: Set `rate` equal to 1 to maintain parity with ether.

      * The `wallet` parameter: Pass in `wallet` from the main constructor. This is the wallet that will get paid all the ether that the crowdsale contract raises.

      * The `token` parameter: Make this the `token` variable where `KaseiCoin` is stored.

    * Assign the address of the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract to the `kasei_crowdsale_address` variable. (This will allow you to easily fetch the crowdsale’s address later.)

    * Set the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract as a minter.

    * Have the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` renounce its minter role.

5. Compile the contract by using compiler version 0.5.0.

6. Check for any errors, and debug them as needed.

7. Take a screenshot of the successful compilation of the contract, and add it to the Evaluation Evidence section of the `README.md` file for your Git repository.

### Step 4: Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain

In this subsection, you’ll deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain. You’ll then perform a real-world, preproduction test of your crowdsale. To do so, complete the following steps:

> **Important:** Record a short video or take screenshots that illustrate the following steps as evidence of your deployed crowdsale contract.

1. Deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain by using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache.

2. Test the functionality of the crowdsale by using test accounts to buy new tokens and then checking the balances of those accounts.

3. Review the total supply of minted tokens and the amount of wei that the crowdsale contract has raised.

### Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

In this optional subsection, you can extend the crowdsale contract to enhance its functionality. To do so, you’ll use the following OpenZeppelin contracts:

* The `CappedCrowdsale` contract: Allows you to cap the total amount of ether that your crowdsale can raise.

* The `TimedCrowdsale` contract: Allows you to set a time limit for your crowdsale by adding an opening time and a closing time.

* The `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` contract: Allows you to refund your investors. Every time that you launch a crowdsale, you set a goal amount of ether to raise. If you don’t reach the goal, it’s a common practice to refund your investors.

> **Hint:** We encourage you to read more about these contracts on the [Crowdsales page](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/crowdsales) of the OpenZeppelin documentation.

To enhance your KaseiCoin crowdsale with this added functionality, complete the following steps:

1. Import the three OpenZeppelin contracts just described into the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol` contract by using the following code:

    ```solidity
    import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v2.5.0/contracts/crowdsale/validation/CappedCrowdsale.sol";
    import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v2.5.0/contracts/crowdsale/validation/TimedCrowdsale.sol";
    import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v2.5.0/contracts/crowdsale/distribution/RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale.sol";
    ```

2. In addition to the `Crowdsale` and `MintedCrowdsale` contracts, which your contract previously inherited from OpenZeppelin, have your `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract inherit the following three contracts, which you just imported:

    * `CappedCrowdsale`

    * `TimedCrowdsale`

    * `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale`

3. In the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` constructor, add the following parameters:

    * The `uint goal` parameter: The amount of ether that you hope to raise during the crowdsale&mdash;that is, the goal of the crowdsale.

    * The `uint open` parameter: The opening time for the crowdsale.

    * The `uint close` parameter: The closing time for the crowdsale.

4. Complete the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` constructor code by adding calls to the new contracts, as the following code shows:

    ```solidity
    constructor(
            uint256 rate, // rate in TKNbits
            address payable wallet, // sale beneficiary
            KaseiCoin token, // the KaseiCoin itself that the KaseiCoinCrowdsale will work with
            uint goal, // the crowdsale goal
            uint open, // the crowdsale opening time
            uint close // the crowdsale closing time
        ) public
            Crowdsale(rate, wallet, token)
            CappedCrowdsale(goal)
            TimedCrowdsale(open, close)
            RefundableCrowdsale(goal)
        {
            // constructor can stay empty
        }
    ```

    > **Important:** The `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` contract itself inherits the `RefundableCrowdsale` contract, which requires a `goal` parameter. So in addition to the others, you must call the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor from your `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` constructor. The `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` contract doesn’t have its own constructor, which is why we use the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor that it inherits.
    >
    > If you forget to call the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor, `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale` will fail. This is because it doesn't have its own constructor, so it relies on the `RefundableCrowdsale` constructor.

5. Update the `KaseiCoinCrowdsaleDeployer` contract to allow the deployment of the updated crowdsale contract. In the constructor of the deployer contract, add a new `uint` parameter named `goal` that will allow you to set the crowdsale goal.

6. You previously added an instance of the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract to the KaseiCoin deployer contract. Because we modified the `KaseiCoinCrowdsale` contract to support new functionality, you now need to update your previous code with the following code:

    ```solidity
    KaseiCoinCrowdsale kasei_crowdsale = new KaseiCoinCrowdsale (1, wallet, token, goal, now, now + 24 weeks);
    ```

    Note that in the preceding code, you added values for the three new parameters. The `goal` parameter represents the amount of ether to raise during the crowdsale. The `now` parameter represents the crowdsale opening time. And, `now + 24 weeks` represents the closing time.

    The `now` function returns the current Ethereum block timestamp in the form of seconds since the Unix epoch. The **Unix epoch** (also known as **Unix time**, **POSIX time**, or **Unix timestamp**) is an integer representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (at midnight coordinated universal time, UTC), not counting leap seconds.

7. Compile and test the updated contract by completing following steps:

    * Send ether to the crowdsale from a different account (that is, not the same account that’s raising funds). Then, once you confirm that the crowdsale works as expected, try to add the token to your wallet and to test a transaction.

    * Set the `close` time to `now + 5 minutes` (for a shorter crowdsale) or to any timeline that you'd like to test.

    * When sending ether to the contract, make sure that you meet the `goal` of the contract. Then finalize the sale by using the `finalize` function of the `Crowdsale` contract. Note that to finalize the sale, `isOpen` must return false (`isOpen` comes from `TimedCrowdsale` and checks whether the `close` time has passed). If you set the `goal` to 300 ether, for example, you might need to have multiple accounts buy tokens to meet the goal. If you run out of prefunded accounts in Ganache, you can create a new workspace.

    * Review your tokens in MetaMask. To do so in MetaMask, click Add Token, click Custom Token, and then enter the address of the token contract. Make sure to buy larger amounts of tokens to get the denomination to appear in your wallet as more than a few wei worth.

8. Create a GitHub repository and a `README.md` file that explains the process for buying KaseiCoin.

Make sure that your `README.md` file includes screenshots that illustrate the functionality of your contracts as the earlier instructions detailed.

You can also record your interactions with the executed contract as a short video or an animated GIF. To record a video, you can use the following tools:

* If you’re working on macOS, you can create a screen recording by using the built-in QuickTime player. To learn more about this tool, refer to [Use QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721#quicktime) in the Apple Support documentation.

* If you’re working on Windows 10, you can create a screen recording by using the built-in Xbox Game Bar. To learn more about this tool, refer to [Use Xbox Game Bar to capture game clips and screenshots on Windows 10](https://beta.support.xbox.com/help/friends-social-activity/share-socialize/record-game-clips-game-bar-windows-10) in the Microsoft Support documentation.
